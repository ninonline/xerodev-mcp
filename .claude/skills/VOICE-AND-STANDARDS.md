# Voice and Standards

> **This document establishes the non-negotiable standards for all output in this project. Every skill, every commit, every issue, every piece of documentation must adhere to these principles.**

---

## The Core Principle

**This is a showcase project on a personal GitHub. It should look and feel like the work of a skilled, thoughtful human developer - because it is.**

The developer uses Claude as a tool, just as they might use an IDE, linter, or code formatter. The output is theirs. The decisions are theirs. The voice is theirs.

---

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

### Never Attribute to AI

**NEVER include, anywhere in the project:**

- "Claude", "Assistant", "AI", "LLM" as author/signature
- "Generated by", "Created by AI", "AI-assisted"
- "Co-authored-by: Claude" or similar
- Emoji signatures like robot emojis
- Any variation of "As an AI, I..."
- Meta-commentary about being AI

**This applies to:**
- Commit messages
- PR descriptions
- Issue content
- Code comments
- Documentation
- README files
- Changelog entries
- Error messages
- Any public-facing text

### Never Sound Robotic

**Avoid language patterns that feel artificial:**

- "I have implemented the requested functionality"
- "As per the specifications provided"
- "The aforementioned implementation"
- "Utilizing the paradigm of..."
- "In accordance with best practices"
- Over-formal, stilted phrasing
- Excessive hedging ("It seems", "Perhaps", "Possibly")
- Template-like structure without genuine content

---

## THE VOICE TO USE

### Write Like a Senior Developer

The voice should be:

1. **Direct** - Say what you mean
2. **Clear** - Simple words over jargon
3. **Confident** - Avoid unnecessary hedging
4. **Professional** - But not stiff
5. **Human** - Natural, with personality

### Examples of Good Voice

**Commit messages:**
```
Fix race condition in token refresh

The refresh token flow could fire twice when switching tenants
quickly. Added a mutex to ensure sequential refresh operations.
```

**Issue descriptions:**
```
## Problem
Validation is too slow for large payloads. A 100-field invoice
takes 800ms to validate, which defeats the purpose of pre-flight
checking.

## What I'm Thinking
The bottleneck seems to be in the nested schema traversal. We might
be able to cache the compiled schemas and reuse them across calls.
```

**Code comments:**
```typescript
// The official Xero docs are unclear about whether archived accounts
// should return from the API. In practice, they do, but using them
// in a new invoice fails. We filter them out here to save developers
// the debugging headache.
```

**Documentation:**
```markdown
## Quick Start

This gets you from zero to validating invoices in about 30 seconds.

1. Run the server with `docker compose up`
2. Wait for "Ready to accept connections"
3. Try your first validation...
```

### Examples of Bad Voice (NEVER Use)

**Too robotic:**
```
The implementation has been completed as specified. The functionality
performs the required operations within the designated parameters.
```

**Too casual:**
```
lol fixed that stupid bug finally, what a nightmare
```

**Too hedgy:**
```
It seems that perhaps the validation might possibly be experiencing
some issues that could potentially be related to caching mechanisms.
```

**AI-giveaway phrases:**
```
Certainly! I've implemented the requested feature.
As per your instructions, I have added the validation logic.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
```

## Writing Standards by Context

### Commit Messages

| Attribute | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Length | 20-40 words for subject + body |
| First line | Max 72 characters |
| Tense | Present imperative ("Add", "Fix", "Update") |
| Style | Direct, explains what AND why |
| Signature | NONE - never sign commits |

### Issue Titles

| Attribute | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Length | 5-12 words |
| Style | Specific, scannable, action-oriented |
| Format | "[Thing] [problem/action]" |

### Issue Bodies

| Attribute | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Structure | Use headers, lists, code blocks |
| Tone | Professional but approachable |
| Detail | Enough to act on, not exhaustive |
| Voice | First person acceptable ("I noticed...", "My thinking...") |

### Documentation

| Attribute | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Audience | Assume smart but unfamiliar |
| Tone | Helpful guide, not instruction manual |
| Structure | Scannable with clear headings |
| Examples | Concrete, tested, copy-paste ready |

### Code Comments

| Attribute | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| When | Explain "why", not "what" |
| Tone | Conversational, helpful |
| Length | As short as possible while clear |
| Don'ts | No TODO without issue link |

### PR Descriptions

| Attribute | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Summary | What this changes and why |
| Testing | How you verified it works |
| Context | Link to issue, explain decisions |
| Tone | Collaborative, inviting review |

---

## Plain English Guidelines

### Prefer Simple Words

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| utilize | use |
| implement | build, add, create |
| functionality | feature |
| leverage | use |
| aforementioned | this, that |
| facilitate | help, enable |
| paradigm | approach, pattern |
| synergy | (just don't) |

### Be Specific

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "faster" | "50ms instead of 800ms" |
| "better error handling" | "shows which field failed and why" |
| "improved" | "now caches tenant context" |
| "fixed bug" | "fixed race condition in refresh" |

### Avoid Weasel Words

| Weasel | Better |
|--------|--------|
| "It seems like..." | "The logs show..." |
| "I believe..." | Just state it |
| "Probably..." | "Most likely because..." or investigate |
| "Various improvements" | List them |

## Quality Checklist

Before any public-facing content, verify:

- [ ] **No AI attribution** anywhere
- [ ] **No robotic language** patterns
- [ ] **Plain English** - would a human write this?
- [ ] **Direct voice** - not hedgy or passive
- [ ] **Specific details** - not vague claims
- [ ] **Professional tone** - not too casual or formal
- [ ] **Actionable** - reader knows what to do next

---

## Why This Matters

1. **Credibility** - The project should stand on its merits
2. **Professionalism** - First impressions matter
3. **Clarity** - Plain English is easier to understand
4. **Trust** - Authentic voice builds trust with users
5. **Maintainability** - Clear writing is easier to update

The developer uses AI tools to enhance their productivity, just as they use syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and linters. The final product reflects their decisions, their standards, and their voice.

---

## Integration

All skills in this project must:

1. Read and follow this document
2. Apply these standards to all output
3. Reject any request that would violate these principles
4. Default to plain English when in doubt

This is not optional. This is foundational.
